### What is the Data Science wiki?
The code for the 'Data Science wiki', a website created with the goal of democratizing Data Science technology, is preserved.
The link to the homepage is here.


### How to add a page to the Data Science wiki
Create a new branch from the develop branch and add the notebook to the appropriate directory. After that, please create a pull request to the develop branch and merge it if there are no problems, then merge it to the main branch if there are no problems, and it will be reflected in the Data Science wiki.
